## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

**Note**: You can choose any text editor or web browser that you prefer instead of Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome. The setup process might differ slightly, but the fundamental concepts of web design and development will remain the same.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Visual Studio Code**
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.

2. **Install Extensions**
   - Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
   - Install the following recommended extensions:
     - **Live Server**: Allows you to run a local server for your HTML and CSS files.
     - **HTML CSS Support**: Enhances your HTML and CSS development experience.
     - **Open in Browser**: Enables you to open your HTML files directly in your default web browser.

3. **Create Your Project Folder**
   - Create a new folder on your computer for your web project.

4. **Create Your First HTML File**
   - Inside your project folder, create a file named `index.html`.
   - Add the following basic structure to your HTML file:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>My Web Project</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Welcome to My Web Project!</h1>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

5. **Open Your Project in Visual Studio Code**
   - Open Visual Studio Code and use the `Open Folder` option to navigate to your project folder.

6. **Run Your Project with Live Server**
   - Right-click on your `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server** to see your web project in action.

7. **Open in Browser Option**
   - Alternatively, you can open your HTML file in your default web browser by right-clicking on the `index.html` file and selecting **Open in Default Browser** (if you have the "Open in Browser" extension installed).

## Using the Environment
You're now ready to start coding! Use Visual Studio Code to write your HTML and CSS files, and watch your changes in real-time in Google Chrome.
